            <article class="post-content">
                <p>That we can tuck in our children at night and know that they are fed and clothed and safe from harm. But as Americans, we also know that this is a nation of laws, and we cannot have those laws broken when more than 2,000 people cross our borders illegally every day. It was stained by this nation's original sin of slavery, a question that divided the colonies and brought the convention to a stalemate until the founders chose to allow the slave trade to continue for at least twenty more years, and to leave any final resolution to future generations. They all have different stories and reasons. I have made it clear to the Iraqi people that we pursue no bases, and no claim on their territory or resources. That is why I intend to personally pursue this outcome with all the patience that the task requires.</p>
                <p>They held vigils across this country when four little girls were killed in the 16th Street Baptist Church. We will help Iraq train its Security Forces and develop its economy.</p>
                <p>We're not going to agree on everything, but we can disagree without being disagreeable. You see, we Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country.</p>
                <p>We have the most powerful military on Earth, but that's not what makes us strong. I know, too, that Islam has always been a part of America's story. Islam has a proud tradition of tolerance.</p>
                <p>It's not enough, but it's helping. That has been my experience at Trinity. They all have different stories and reasons. That's not the judgment we need. Because if you don't have any fresh ideas, then you use stale tactics to scare the voters. Words alone cannot meet the needs of our people.</p>
                <p>And so they need an assurance that somebody out there cares about them, is listening to them - that they are not just destined to travel down that long road toward nothingness. Because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government. For eighteen long months, you have stood up, one by one, and said enough to the politics of the past. It's a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night, and a promise that you make to yours - a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a promise that led workers to picket lines, and women to reach for the ballot. Not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save. Resistance through violence and killing is wrong and does not succeed.</p>
