            <article class="post-content">
                <p>It&#8217;s 2020, I&#8217;ve just turned 31 and I feel a little lost. I&#8217;m cruising in my marketing job, I have a <a href="http://www.thepodcastshuffle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">podcast newsletter</a> which I enjoy but it only takes up about 3-4 hours of my spare time. I&#8217;m just going through the motions.</p>
                <p>All this has left me in an odd place, one that leaves me feeling a little bit empty and lost. I feel particularly empty because I&#8217;ve done everything I&#8217;m supposed to. Go to University. Get a good job. Earn a good income. It looks like I&#8217;m winning the game they tell you to play. But, it doesn&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m winning, I feel like a caged animal. I’m searching. Searching for something to give me more freedom.</p>
                <p>I don’t want the freedom that is fleeting. Not freedom like the kind I get on the weekends with photography. That kind of freedom. It doesn&#8217;t help me escape the need to rely on a full-time corporate job for income. Right now, I&#8217;m just living for the weekends. I feel like a small cog in a giant machine. Therefore to become freer, I&#8217;ve realized, I wanted to learn something that could possibly give me another income stream.</p>
                <p>So&#8230;what could I do to fill the void in my life? I know I want to generate a passive income, give myself options to change my career and most importantly I want to build things. Lots of things. But, what I wanted to build, I wasn&#8217;t sure.</p>
                <p>Currently, I have a few skills that I&#8217;m good at:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Brand marketing</li>
                <li>Market Research</li>
                <li>Networking</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The issue with these skills is that they don&#8217;t give me many opportunities to build. I love introverted networking and meeting new people. I could teach people how to do this but it doesn&#8217;t fill my need to build lots of things. What I do know is, if you want to build anything really new and exciting. Learning some form of programming is the best way to go about it.</p>
                <p>Programming has previously interested me. I&#8217;ve dabbled in Python and made a few usable scripts but I&#8217;ve never been particularly good at it. I can hack things together using other&#8217;s code, but I haven&#8217;t really got any further than that. I think there are two key reasons I&#8217;ve never got past the fundamentals.</p>
                <ol>
                <li>I&#8217;ve never had a project to focus on that I could practice and refine my skills.</li>
                <li>I never consistently coded, I go for a few weeks then get busy at work and it would drop off.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>I&#8217;ve always loved computers ever since my dad bought home our first family computer way back in the &#8217;90s. I&#8217;d play games like Duke Nukem and Commander Keen until my eyeballs bled. I went from playing games on computers to building my own computer at 14. But, I never really played around with coding. I didn&#8217;t even understand that you wrote games and software with code.</p>
                <p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-29 " src="http://peterlunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/commander-keen.png" alt="Commander Keen screen shot from the original game" width="501" height="313" srcset="https://peterlunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/commander-keen-200x125.png 200w, https://peterlunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/commander-keen-300x188.png 300w, https://peterlunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/commander-keen.png 320w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /></p>
                <div id="attachment_30" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-30" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-30" src="http://peterlunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/duke-nukem.png" alt="Screenshot from the original duke nukem game " width="501" height="313" srcset="https://peterlunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/duke-nukem-200x125.png 200w, https://peterlunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/duke-nukem-300x188.png 300w, https://peterlunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/duke-nukem.png 320w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p id="caption-attachment-30" class="wp-caption-text">Duke Nuken and Commander Keen where I first fell in love with computers</p></div>
                <p>But recently, I&#8217;ve started to understand the power of code. Not just for making games. It&#8217;s a power that could give me the freedom I seek. I want to channel the love I had for computers as a child into who I am now. I want to learn to code. But, first I need to figure out what language I want to learn.</p>
                <h2><strong>So how do I choose what language to learn?</strong></h2>
                <p>Originally I started where everybody starts&#8230;I Googled what programming language to learn. The search threw up a bunch of results, from that I started to string together some key themes.</p>
                <p>The key insights I took from the search were:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Job Market (job demand) is important &#8211; it gives you flexibility. Because, if you love what you&#8217;re learning and want to get employed without a degree, you probably want to learn a language that is high in demand.</li>
                <li>Language popularity &#8211; popularity means there will be a community that can help you learn. It also means that there are a ton of useful resources out there.</li>
                <li>Pick a language that aligns with what you want to do &#8211; want to build apps? Learn objective C. Want to analyze data? learn Python. Want to build Websites? JavaScript is a good bet.</li>
                <li>What difficulty are you willing to pursue? &#8211; If it&#8217;s been a while since you&#8217;ve learned a new skill, it might be best to start with a language that is easier to learn. That will allow you to learn the basic syntax and then progress to other languages.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>From these insights, I figured there were essentially two paths I can take.</p>
                <p><strong>Path 1:</strong> You can start by learning a low difficulty language, that has a simple syntax and then progress to other languages as you know what you want to do.</p>
                <p><strong>Path 2:</strong> You can choose a language that aligns with your end goals.</p>
                <p>The first time I dabbled in code, I went with path 1. I&#8217;d read Python was easy to pick up and learn, I thought I&#8217;d learn and then inspiration would strike and I&#8217;d start building things. Unfortunately, it didn&#8217;t work out that way. The inspiration never really came.</p>
                <p>This time around I&#8217;m going to take path 2 and learn JavaScript as I have some projects I want to build that I can make with JavaScript. But, before I get into that project, there are a few other reasons I want to learn JavaScript. My reasons and thinking should be useful for you to understand as you go about picking a path for yourself.</p>
                <h2><strong>Job Market</strong></h2>
                <p>The first thing I looked into was the job market. Although a job isn&#8217;t the end goal, I wanted to know that if I really like the language how hard would it be to get a job?</p>
                <h3><strong>Demand</strong></h3>
                <p>The first thing I wanted to understand was which programming languages are in high demand. So I looked at which ones were frequently listed in indeed software developer ads. Looking over the last few years JavaScript demand has remained relatively consistent, so it appears to be a solid building block language to springboard my learning.</p>
                <p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-26 size-fusion-600" src="http://peterlunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/How-do-our-usual-languages-fare__Worldwide-jobs-on-indeed.com-2-600x514.png" alt="Programming languages mentions in indeed ads over the last 4 years" width="600" height="514" srcset="https://peterlunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/How-do-our-usual-languages-fare__Worldwide-jobs-on-indeed.com-2-200x171.png 200w, https://peterlunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/How-do-our-usual-languages-fare__Worldwide-jobs-on-indeed.com-2-300x257.png 300w, https://peterlunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/How-do-our-usual-languages-fare__Worldwide-jobs-on-indeed.com-2-400x342.png 400w, https://peterlunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/How-do-our-usual-languages-fare__Worldwide-jobs-on-indeed.com-2-600x514.png 600w, https://peterlunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/How-do-our-usual-languages-fare__Worldwide-jobs-on-indeed.com-2-768x658.png 768w, https://peterlunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/How-do-our-usual-languages-fare__Worldwide-jobs-on-indeed.com-2-800x685.png 800w, https://peterlunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/How-do-our-usual-languages-fare__Worldwide-jobs-on-indeed.com-2-1024x877.png 1024w, https://peterlunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/How-do-our-usual-languages-fare__Worldwide-jobs-on-indeed.com-2.png 1168w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
                <h3><strong>Salary</strong></h3>
                <p>I like to get paid, I also like to get paid well. So I wanted to investigate salary.  To investigate salary I decided to look at the average salaries for a software developer in the US and then at the salaries being paid in Silicon Valley. As I&#8217;ve often strived to be the best in my field I wanted to see what I could earn if I made it to the coding Mecca.</p>
                <div id="attachment_27" style="width: 611px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-27" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-27 size-full" src="http://peterlunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/salaries.jpg" alt="Average salaries of programming languages - 2017/2018" width="601" height="550" srcset="https://peterlunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/salaries-200x183.jpg 200w, https://peterlunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/salaries-300x275.jpg 300w, https://peterlunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/salaries-400x366.jpg 400w, https://peterlunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/salaries.jpg 601w" sizes="(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px" /><p id="caption-attachment-27" class="wp-caption-text">Although the data is a few years old now, it gives a good indication the JavaScript developers get paid.</p></div>
                <p>From my research, I saw that JavaScript was relatively well paid. Coupled that with the high demand for the skill and it meant if a career change was on the cards I would still have my financial stability.</p>
                <h3><strong>Company stacks</strong></h3>
                <p>Next, I wanted to know which programming languages were used in certain organizations. As I have a few organizations I&#8217;m particularly fond of like Amazon and Product Hunt. So I wanted to see what they used. Searching for jobs on their website there are a lot of roles going that require proficiency in JavaScript that interested me.</p>
                <p>You can check out the stacks of companies <a href="https://stackshare.io/stacks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, it&#8217;s cool but I didn&#8217;t put too much weight into this as these organizations move so fast and are constantly growing their product portfolios.</p>
                <p>For me, this was the lowest of the factors that weighed into my decision for which language to learn. Although I&#8217;d love to work for Amazon and contribute to making amazing products. If my role was doing something I didn&#8217;t love in the process of making that product, well I&#8217;d be right back to where I am now. So, if you&#8217;re looking more to do what you love rather than work for a company you might love don&#8217;t stress about this.</p>
                <h2><strong>Community</strong></h2>
                <p>The next area I wanted to explore and one of the most important to me, was what the community is like. The areas of community I most wanted to understand were: can I get access to good tutorials, are there people I can reach out to for help, what&#8217;s the twitter scene like, are there local meet-ups and are there open source projects I can contribute too. These were all things I really enjoyed about the Python community that motivated me to keep learning.</p>
                <p>One thing I absolutely loved when I was learning Python was attending Pycon Australia. A conference for all things Python. I was only a beginner, but everyone there was amazing. I felt super welcome, even though I was a beginner and had never worked as a developer. I learned heaps. And I got an awesome t-shirt I still wear now. So I definitely wanted to do more of that.</p>
                <p>I thought the best place to start in order to see if there was a thriving community was GitHub, and their &#8216;<a href="https://octoverse.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">State of the Octoverse</a>&#8216; report. Why? Because GitHub is home to a lot of awesome open-source projects. My thinking was if there are lots of projects using one language that means there might be a big community for that language. Looking at the State of the Octoverse report for 2019 one chart really stuck out to me.</p>
                <div id="attachment_28" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-28" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-28 size-fusion-600" src="http://peterlunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-02-at-21.22.13-600x414.png" alt="Chart showing the most popular programming languages on github overtime" width="600" height="414" srcset="https://peterlunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-02-at-21.22.13-200x138.png 200w, https://peterlunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-02-at-21.22.13-300x207.png 300w, https://peterlunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-02-at-21.22.13-400x276.png 400w, https://peterlunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-02-at-21.22.13-600x414.png 600w, https://peterlunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-02-at-21.22.13-768x529.png 768w, https://peterlunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-02-at-21.22.13-800x551.png 800w, https://peterlunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-02-at-21.22.13-1024x706.png 1024w, https://peterlunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-02-at-21.22.13-1200x827.png 1200w, https://peterlunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-02-at-21.22.13.png 1506w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><p id="caption-attachment-28" class="wp-caption-text">JavaScript is consistently the number one</p></div>
                <p>The consistency of popularity of JavaScript was a real positive, it means there are lots of opportunities to contribute to open-source projects and learn from others that do so. I definitely made me start looking into JavaScript seriously.</p>
                <p>Next, I also did a <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23javascript&amp;src=typeahead_click" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#javascript</a> search on twitter and found a community brimming with people talking enthusiastically about the language so another big tick.</p>
                <p>Another big resource of community when learning python was the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">r/python</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">r/learnpython</a> subreddits. The learning subreddit was a great resource and community to post problems, search to see if others had the same problem and to chat with others struggling. It meant I didn&#8217;t feel so alone in the process. Thankfully there is a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">r/learnjavascript</a> with over 100K subscribers at the time of writing this.</p>
                <p>The Python subreddit was fantastic to get an idea of what I could be making in the future. So many people were posting awesome projects on there and discussing them, it was very inspiring. Again Reddit has a vibrant community for JavaScript <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">r/javascript</a> and it had a <a href="https://poke95.now.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PokeDex project</a> that inspired me to start learning.</p>
                <p>The community is a huge one for me. Self-directed learning is a lonely pursuit. It is nice to know there are others out there going through the same struggles, and there are people willing to help.</p>
                <p>Thanks to Reddit I&#8217;ve already found someone willing to do paired programming with me each week to help me get over the hump of what I&#8217;m learning. How good is that?</p>
                <h2><strong>Can I build things?</strong></h2>
                <p>Finally, the biggest reason I choose JavaScript is because of what it will allow me to build. Below is the list of things I wrote out that I wanted to make.</p>
                <ol>
                <li>I want to build out my podcast shuffle business and be the technical founder while letting my other founder take the lead with other areas of the business.
                <ul>
                <li>So HTML and CSS we&#8217;re a great starting point for me.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>I want to build a chrome extension for daily gratitude.
                <ul>
                <li>You can build these with Javascript and React.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>I want to make a SaaS product. Using one thing I&#8217;m good at Market Research.
                <ul>
                <li>Again can be built using JavaScript and other libraries.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Javascript will allow me to build all of these projects and that is the reason I chose JavaScript. Because even though it is nice to know there are great job opportunities out there and a great community. What I really want to do is make things. I want to make things I think are cool and hopefully, I can use my marketing skills to find other people who will think they are cool too.</p>
                <p>The making and creating is what hopefully will set me free from the 9-5 grind. At the very least, it might mean I&#8217;m able to find a job that is more aligned to my strengths and values. For me the money doesn&#8217;t matter, I just need enough to live a comfortable life. What I truly value is the freedom of choice in the work I do and the time I do it. JavaScript is the first, and right step on the path to me achieving that goal.</p>
                <p>I’m insanely excited about learning JavaScript. The thought of building things has my giddish. If you&#8217;re excited by the thought of building things and learning something new, I’ll be doing a post on how I’m learning and how you can join me so stay tuned for that.</p>
                <p><a href="http://peterlunch.com/why-im-learning-to-code-and-maybe-you-should-too/">Now I&#8217;m off to learn to code</a>, if you&#8217;re keen to jump in and learn as well <a href="https://twitter.com/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">let me know</a>.</p>
